 # What is JSON File?
 Short for JavaScript Object Notation
 This is a way of describing data.
 It's not the easiest to read yourself, but it's compact and easy to parse for computers, which makes it popular online where bandwidth is at a premium.

 Example JSON code(Whitehouse):
    
    {
       "metadata":{
          "responseInfo":{
             "status":200,
             "developerMessage":"OK",
    } },
       "results":[
          {
             "title":"Legal immigrants should get freedom before
    undocumented immigrants – moral, just and fair",
             "body":"I am petitioning President Trump's
    Administration to take a humane view of the plight of legal
    immigrants. Specifically, legal immigrants in Employment Based
    (EB) category. I believe, such immigrants were short changed in
    the recently announced reforms via Executive Action (EA), which
    was otherwise long due and a welcome announcement.",
    "issues":[ {
    "id":"28",
                   "name":"Human Rights"
                },
    {
                "id":"29",
                "name":"Immigration"
             }
          ],
          "signatureThreshold":100000,
          "signatureCount":267,
          "signaturesNeeded":99733,
 }, {
          "title":"National database for police shootings.",
          "body":"There is no reliable national data on how many
          people are shot by police officers each year. In signing this
          petition, I am urging the President to bring an end to this
          absence of visibility by creating a federally controlled,
          publicly accessible database of officer-involved shootings.",
          "issues":[ {
          "id":"28",
                         "name":"Human Rights"
                      }
                   ],
                   "signatureThreshold":100000,
                   "signatureCount":17453,

 1. There's a metadata value, which contains a responseInfo value, which in turn contains a status value. Status 200 is what internet developers use for "everything is OK."
 2. There's a results value, which contains a series of petitions.
 3. Each petition contains a title, a body, some issues it relates to, plus some signature
 information.
 4. JSON has strings and integers too. Notice how the strings are all wrapped in quotes,
 whereas the integers aren't.

 Swift has a built-in support called Codable
 Int and String automatically conform to Codable
